## **SQL Queries**  
SQL was used extensively to analyze and preprocess the data. Below are the key analyses performed:  

### **Distribution Analysis**  
- **Warehouse Blocks**:

 Our dataset is clean and contains no duplicate entries. The warehouse block distribution reveals that Block F handles the highest volume of shipments (3,666), followed by Blocks D, A, C, and B, each with an equal share of 1,833 shipments.

- **Shipment Modes and Customer Ratings**:
 ![Alt text](https://github.com/safae-ahb/E-COMMERCE-SHIPPING-DASHBOARD-/blob/e396c626e3cfac4256c39a3843592777fb01bbdc/2.PNG)

Shipment Modes: The majority of shipments were made via Ship, with significantly fewer shipments handled by Flight and Road.
Customer Ratings: The ratings are fairly balanced across the five categories, indicating a mix of feedback from customers. This can help in understanding customer satisfaction trends and shipment performance

### **Performance Metrics**  
- **On-Time vs Delayed Deliveries** and- **Average Discounts by Delivery Status**:
  
![Alt text](https://github.com/safae-ahb/E-COMMERCE-SHIPPING-DASHBOARD-/blob/e396c626e3cfac4256c39a3843592777fb01bbdc/3.PNG)

On-time Deliveries (0): There are 4,436 products delivered on time, with an average discount of 5. On-time deliveries have lower discounts.
Late Deliveries (1): There are 6,563 products delivered late, with an average discount of 18. Late deliveries have higher discounts, likely to compensate customers for the delay.

- **Customer Rating**:  

![Alt text](https://github.com/safae-ahb/E-COMMERCE-SHIPPING-DASHBOARD-/blob/e396c626e3cfac4256c39a3843592777fb01bbdc/6.PNG)

There is a slight positive correlation between customer ratings and the average cost of products. As the customer rating increases, the average cost of the product tends to increase slightly as well.This suggests that customers may be willing to pay a premium for higher-rated products. Businesses could potentially leverage this by strategically pricing their products based on perceived value and expected customer ratings.

Warehouse D has the highest average customer rating (3), while the other warehouse blocks (F, C, B, and A) have lower average ratings (2). This suggests that Warehouse D may have better operational efficiency, leading to faster delivery times, fewer errors, and overall better customer satisfaction.

### **Warehouse & Shipping Delay Analysis **  

![Alt text](https://github.com/safae-ahb/E-COMMERCE-SHIPPING-DASHBOARD-/blob/e396c626e3cfac4256c39a3843592777fb01bbdc/4.PNG)

Warehouse Block B has the highest delay percentage, followed by blocks F and D. However, the differences in delay percentages between these blocks are relatively small.
Flight is the shipment mode with the most delays, followed by "Ship" and "Road." Similar to the warehouse blocks, the differences in delay percentages between these shipment modes are not substantial.

### **Correlation Between Discounts Delays and weight **  

![Alt text](https://github.com/safae-ahb/E-COMMERCE-SHIPPING-DASHBOARD-/blob/e396c626e3cfac4256c39a3843592777fb01bbdc/5.PNG)

When orders are not reached on time (Reached_on_Time_Y_N = 0), the average discount offered is significantly lower (5) compared to orders that are delivered on time (18). Additionally, the average weight of products in delayed orders is higher (4168 gms) than those delivered on time (3272 gms).
This suggests that lower discounts and heavier products may be associated with a higher likelihood of shipping delays.

Flight has the highest delay percentage at 60.15%, followed by Ship (59.76%) and Road (58.81%).
While Flight has the highest delay percentage, the differences between the modes are relatively small.The analysis suggests that the choice of shipment mode may not have a significant impact on the likelihood of delays.
As the number of customer care calls increases, the delay percentage tends to decrease slightly.
The highest delay percentage (65.20%) is observed for orders with 2 customer care calls, while the lowest (51.63%) is for orders with 6 calls.
The decrease in delay percentage with increasing customer care calls may indicate that proactive communication with customers helps to resolve issues and prevent delays
